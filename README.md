# AEVS
Advance Electronic Voting System was made to replace the current voting system that uses ballet papers.

The System was developed in PHP and JavaScripts and MySql database is used.

After the voting, system can count the results and display results graphically.

You can also view the previous election results and compare them.

Enjoy!!
